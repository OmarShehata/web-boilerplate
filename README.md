# Phaser Game Boilerplate

Set up for making games in Phaser. Inspired by [Hikari's Station](https://github.com/OmarShehata/hikari-station) which has been my most complete Phaser game. See also [Phaser examples](http://phaser.io/examples/v3) and [Phaser docs](https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/).

Art from [Kenney platformer](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/platformer-characters) and [jumper pack](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/jumper-pack).

Music from [Newgrounds, WaxTerK](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/879176) and [OpenGameArt library of sounds](https://opengameart.org/content/library-of-game-sounds).

This little demo shows:

- Basic game setup
- How to create a loading screen
- How to load a spritesheet animation. See [TexturePacker tutorial](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker/tutorials/how-to-create-sprite-sheets-for-phaser3)
- Make the game canvas correctly resize and center on the page
- Basic collision
- Move player with keyboard
- Move camera around
- Load and play audio
